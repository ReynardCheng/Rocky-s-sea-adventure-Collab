Attach CameraSwitch script to Main Camera.


CameraSwitch.cs requires two Transform components and one GameObject to be dragged into inspector.

1)playerViewPos
This Transform is where the camera will be positioned when locked onto player.
2)shipViewPos
Create an empty gameobject, and put it as a child of the ship gameobject.
Position the empty gameobject to where you want the camera to be when in ship view.
You can also change the rotation of the empty gameobject.

3)ship
Just drag the ship gameobject into the "ship" field in the inspector.
